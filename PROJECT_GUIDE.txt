3. MACHINE LEARNING MODELS
---------------------------
Six algorithms were trained and evaluated:

Model                      Accuracy  Precision  Recall  F1-Score  ROC-AUC
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Support Vector Machine      77.80%    47.14%   74.94%   57.87%   84.52%
Random Forest               85.90%    78.54%   42.26%   54.95%   85.25%
Decision Tree               74.70%    42.11%   64.86%   51.06%   74.17%
Logistic Regression         69.75%    37.04%   69.53%   48.33%   78.12%
K-Nearest Neighbors         83.30%    65.94%   37.10%   47.48%   76.63%

WINNER: Gradient Boosting Classifier
  • Best overall F1-Score (balances precision and recall)
  • High accuracy and ROC-AUC
  • Excellent for imbalanced classification
  • Robust to overfitting

4. MODEL EVALUATION METRICS
----------------------------
Confusion Matrix (Gradient Boosting):
                  Predicted
              No Churn  Churn
Actual   No      1540     53     (Low False Positives)
         Yes      208    199     (Moderate False Negatives)

Key Metrics:
  • True Negatives:  1,540 (correctly identified loyal customers)
  • True Positives:    199 (correctly identified churners)
  • False Negatives:   208 (missed churners - business risk)
  • False Positives:    53 (false alarms - minor cost)

Additional Metrics:
  • Specificity: 96.67% (excellent at identifying loyal customers)
  • NPV: 88.10% (high confidence in "no churn" predictions)

5. FEATURE IMPORTANCE ANALYSIS
-------------------------------
Top 10 Features (Gradient Boosting):

Rank  Feature                        Importance
----  -------                        ----------
 1    Age                              37.21%  (Strongest predictor)
 2    Number of Products               29.03%  (Second most important)
 3    Active Products Interaction       6.99%
 4    Active Member                     6.92%
 5    Balance                           4.65%
 6    Country                           3.85%
 7    Balance to Salary Ratio           2.75%
 8    Age Group                         2.21%
 9    Credit Score                      1.87%
10    Estimated Salary                  1.81%

BUSINESS INSIGHTS & RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================

KEY FINDINGS FROM DATA ANALYSIS
--------------------------------

1. GENDER IMPACT
   • Female customers: 25.00% churn rate
   • Male customers: 16.45% churn rate
   → ACTION: Develop targeted retention programs for female customers

2. GEOGRAPHIC PATTERNS
   • Germany: 32.44% churn rate (HIGHEST)
   • Spain: 20.29% churn rate
   • France: 16.15% churn rate (LOWEST)
   → ACTION: Investigate German market issues, improve services

3. AGE FACTOR
   • Older customers (45+) show significantly higher churn
   • Average age of churners: ~45 years
   • Average age of retained: ~37 years
   → ACTION: Senior-focused retention strategies

4. PRODUCT USAGE
   • 1-2 products: Lower churn risk
   • 3-4 products: HIGHER churn risk (counterintuitive!)
   → ACTION: Review product bundling strategy, may indicate over-selling

5. ACTIVITY LEVEL
   • Inactive members: Much higher churn
   • Active members: Significantly lower churn
   → ACTION: Engagement campaigns to activate dormant customers

6. ACCOUNT BALANCE
   • Zero balance: Higher churn risk
   • Very high balance (>200K): Also higher churn risk
   → ACTION: Different strategies for each segment

RETENTION STRATEGY FRAMEWORK
-----------------------------

IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (High Priority):
  1. Flag high-risk customers (predicted churn > 70%)
  2. Personalized outreach within 48 hours
  3. Special retention offers (reduced fees, better rates)
  4. Customer satisfaction survey
  5. Account manager assignment

MEDIUM-TERM STRATEGIES:
  1. Improve product experience (especially for multi-product users)
  2. Enhance digital engagement tools
  3. Develop age-specific service packages
  4. Country-specific service improvements
  5. Loyalty rewards program

LONG-TERM INITIATIVES:
  1. Continuous model monitoring and retraining
  2. A/B test retention strategies
  3. Customer journey optimization
  4. Predictive analytics integration
  5. Automated intervention system

COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS
----------------------
Assumptions:
  • Average customer lifetime value: $5,000
  • Cost of acquisition: $500
  • Cost of retention campaign: $50
  • Success rate of intervention: 30%

Without Model:
  • Lost customers: 2,037
  • Lost value: $10,185,000

With Model (assuming 30% of identified churners retained):
  • Customers saved: ~200
  • Value saved: ~$1,000,000
  • Campaign cost: ~$100,000
  • Net benefit: ~$900,000

ROI: 900% (excluding development costs)

ADVANCED USAGE & CUSTOMIZATION
================================================================================

RETRAINING THE MODEL
--------------------
To retrain with new data:

```python
import pandas as pd
import pickle
from sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingClassifier
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# Load new data
df = pd.read_csv('new_data.csv')

# Preprocess and engineer features
# [your preprocessing code here]

# Train model
model = GradientBoostingClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train)

# Save model
with open('best_churn_model.pkl', 'wb') as f:
    pickle.dump(model, f)
```

MAKING BATCH PREDICTIONS
-------------------------
To predict churn for multiple customers:

```python
import pandas as pd
import pickle

# Load model and preprocessors
with open('best_churn_model.pkl', 'rb') as f:
    model = pickle.load(f)
with open('scaler.pkl', 'rb') as f:
    scaler = pickle.load(f)

# Load customer data
customers = pd.read_csv('customers_to_predict.csv')

# Preprocess
# [preprocessing code]

# Predict
predictions = model.predict(features_scaled)
probabilities = model.predict_proba(features_scaled)

# Save results
customers['churn_prediction'] = predictions
customers['churn_probability'] = probabilities[:, 1]
customers.to_csv('predictions.csv', index=False)
```
